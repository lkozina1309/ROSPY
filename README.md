# Tensorflow
ROS scripts for home.made drone in Python.

## Getting Started

All these scripts are used as a template for the scripts I use when going to fly with the drone. There are 2 scripts just for testing the connection and takeoff and land which are part of every script. Other 3 scripts are templates anyone can use by adapting velocities, local positions or global coordinates.

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3.7–3.9
Robotic Operating System
Mavros
```
### Description

ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS is licensed under an open source, BSD license. 

MAVROS is a ROS “node” that can convert between ROS topics and MAVLink messages allowing ArduPilot vehicles to communicate with ROS. It enables MAVLink extendable communication between computers running ROS (1) for any MAVLink enabled autopilot, ground station, or peripheral. MAVROS is the "official" supported bridge between ROS (1) and the MAVLink protocol.
