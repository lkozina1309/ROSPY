# ROSPY

Script for my DIY drone written in rospy. All these scripts are used as a template for the scripts I use when going to fly with the drone. There are 2 scripts just for testing the connection and takeoff and land which are part of every script. Other 3 scripts are templates for scripts I use when I go flying with the drone.
